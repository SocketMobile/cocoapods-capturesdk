/**
 * CaptureHelperDevice regroups the APIs
 * that are related to the device and its configuration.
 *
 * There is no need to create a CaptureHelperDevice, as
 * it is created when CaptureHelper notifies a Device Arrival.
 * A reference of a CaptureHelperDevice is kept in a devices
 * list in CaptureHelper.
 *
 * The main entry point of the CaptureSDK is CaptureHelper.
 * To use CaptureHelper, open it with the method openWithAppInfo.
 *
 * CaptureHelper shares its instance across the application and
 * it is accessible by using the static method [SKTCaptureHelper sharedInstance]
 * It is best to setup the delegates before opening CaptureHelper
 * to make sure to not miss any asynchronous event.
