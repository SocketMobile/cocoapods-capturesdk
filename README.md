# CaptureSDK Version 1.4.0

Socket Mobile is a leading innovator of data capture and delivery solutions for
enhanced productivity.

CaptureSDK is the easiest solution for adding barcode scanning and RFID/NFC
reading capability to an iOS application.

The Socket Mobile barcode scanner and contactless reader/writer are an
ergonomic, fast and accurate solution to a variety of data entry scenarios.

This SDK is very easy to integrate to an application without requirement to
follow a specific design architecture.

Within 10 minutes the barcode scanning or RFID/NFC reading capability can be
integrated into an application.

The CaptureSDK offers a built-in barcode scanner called Softscan, allowing to
test and integrate the SDK even before getting a Socket Mobile scanner, using the exact same API.
